This is an Aqi monitornig application. Which subscribes to a live stream of data and based upon the data it shows you the live Air Quality Index of the particualr city.

We have used websockets here to fetch the live stream of data and then using react hooks we are rendering the data on UI int he form of table. also we are storing previous values for constructing a chart showing the magnified changes in the aqi of a particular city(Mumbai in this case).

Total time taken for making this project is almost 5-7 hours including the deployment. the pplication is deplyed using netlify.
